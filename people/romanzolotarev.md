# Roman Zolotarev runs OpenBSD

I make software for the web. Started my career as a webmaster in
the nineties, then focused on frontend and now on backend. I run
[this job board](https://bsdjobs.com) and make [tutorials for BSD
users](https://www.romanzolotarev.com).

I run [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) everywhere I can: my
desktop, laptop, and all servers.

Why? OpenBSD is a minimalist operating system: my full web development
setup takes 4GB on disk, and rarely eats more than 4GB of memory.

OpenBSD has everything I need in base: X11, cwm, xterm, tmux, vi,
httpd, etc. All those programs are well documented, have consistent
APIs, and sane defaults. There is almost nothing to configure.

You can install OpenBSD on [bare
metal](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/hardware.html) in ten
minutes with all 3rd-party packages and personal data restored from
the latest backup.

Can you build a career around OpenBSD? OpenBSD have used in mission
critical areas (mail servers, application servers, firewalls, load
balancers, workstations, etc).

Frankly, this could be hard to find a job where all computers run
OpenBSD. However, it's a good filter. If your employer runs OpenBSD,
they know what they're doing. OpenBSD is one of the simplest and
elegant Unix-like operating systems, this is why I recommend to
[run it](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/openbsd/), if you want to
learn modern Unix.
